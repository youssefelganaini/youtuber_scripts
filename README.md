# YouTuber Scripts

## Description

This project was created during my Project at Corbado to automate a boring task. We had generated a long list of Tech Creators for a possible collaboration. We found another list online
and wanted to double check which creators on this new list were already on our list - and if not, to add them.

Of course, in a very coder-fashion, I refused to do this boring task if writing a Python script could do it for me in seconds. So I developed this Python script :)
